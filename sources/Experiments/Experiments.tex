\part{Experiments and Validation}

In this part we present some of the results we obtained with our system on several experiments.

Our validation approach for our system was divided in three phases:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Validating the mechanisms of our system on simple representative test cases
\item Evaluating the optimization performances and comparison with existing methods on benchmark test cases
\item Testing the raw performances and scalability capabilities of our system using automatically generated optimization problems.
\end{compactitem}

The first type of optimization problems are small enough to be solved by classical optimization techniques, however they exhibit interesting properties representative of complex optimization problem. We used these problem to identify and tune the required cooperative mechanisms for our system.\\
We also made additional experiments in order to evaluate others functionalities of our systems: uncertainties propagation and adaptations to changes.

The second type of optimization problems correspond to test cases used by the scientific community as benchmarks for comparing MDO methods.

The third type of optimization problems are algorithmically generated with the purpose of producing a base of problems of different sizes and topologies. This allows us to study the behavior when modifying the size of the problems to solve.

In every experiments, we tested the system with only the internal optimization mechanisms of the agents, without providing them with external optimization tools.

\chapter{Behavior Validation using Academic Test Cases}

This section presents some of the results we obtained on several test cases: Turbofan Problem, Viennet1, Rosenbrock's valley and Alexandrov. These test cases are not big enough to be truly qualified of \enquote{complex}, but exhibit specific properties which can be found in complex test cases. Consequently they are useful to study and validate the cooperative behavior of the agents.

In each test cases, the MAS consistently converges towards the best (or one of the best) solution.

\section{Turbofan Problem}

We previously introduce the turbofan problem in \ref{modeling}. As stated before, the problem concerns two \emph{design variables} $pi\_c$ and $bpr$. $pi\_c$ is defined inside the interval [20 - 40] and $bpr$ inside [2 - 10]. The model produces three variables $Tdm0$, $s$ and $fr$.

The problem has two objectives, maximizing $Tdm0$ and minimizing $s$, under the constraint \(s \leq 155\) and \(fr \geq 4\).
This problem exhibit contradictory criteria that need to be handled at different levels ($min s$ and $s \leq 155$ needs to be handled by $s$, the resulting request from $s$ and the others criteria must be handled by $Turbofan Model$), with cooperative trajectory requirements for $bpr$ and $pi\_c$.

On \figurename{} \ref{snecma_res}, the system is executed 100 times with random starting points for each \emph{design variable}, using only internal optimization mechanisms. As we can see, the system consistently converges toward the same optimal solution.

\end{figure}

\section{Viennet1}

The Viennet1 test case is part of a series of problems proposed in \cite{viennet1996multicriteria} to evaluate multi-criteria optimization techniques. This problem involves three objectives. Its analytical formulation is:
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize } 	&o1 = x^2 + (y-1)^2 \\
								&o2 = x^2 + (y+1)^2 \\
								&o3 = (x-1)^2 + y^2 +2\\
\text{where } 		&x, y \in [-4;4]						
\end{align*}				

\figurename{} \ref{viennet_res} illustrates the convergence of the system toward a valid solution with 100 executions from randomly chosen starting points, using only internal optimization mechanisms.

\end{figure}

\section{Rosenbrock's valley}

Rosenbrock's valley is non-convex function commonly used to test convergence capabilities of an optimization method \cite{Rosenbrock01011960}.

The analytical formulation of this problem (for two dimensions) is 
$$\text{Minimize } f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y - x^2)^2$$

The Rosenbrock's valley problem is interesting in the fact that the global minimum is \enquote{hidden} into a narrow parabolic valley. The optimization method must thus get down into the valley and manage to follow its bottom until reaching the global optimum. Consequently it is a very adequate problem to test the cooperative trajectories mechanisms of our system.

The results presented on \figurename{} \ref{rosenbrock_res} are for the two-dimensional version of the problem with a definition domain of [-5; 5] for each \emph{design variable}.

\end{figure}

This problem was also used in \cite{Ilan:1994:MOM:887207} as an application example of the Collaborative Optimization method, presented in chapter \ref{MDO_chapter} (with performances varying from 141 to 1556 total iterations depending on the additional information used).

\section{Alexandrov Problem}

Our last test case is inspired from an academic example taken in literature by Alexandrov \emph{et al}\cite{alexandrov2002analytical}. This example presents many of the commons characteristics of MDO problems: a cycle (albeit converging) and multiple criteria requiring cooperative trajectories. In the original article, the example was used to illustrate some properties of Collaborative Optimization, which we presented earlier, in terms of reformulation. While the paper only gave the structure of the problem, we adapted it with meaningful values and equations.

The mathematical formulation of the problem and the corresponding agent graph can be seen in \figurename{} \ref{alexandrov}. Interestingly, the NDMO representation is quite similar to the one adopted by the original authors of the problem.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

On \figurename{} \ref{alexandrov_res_one}, the behavior of the \emph{design variables} agents l1, l2 and s, as well the evolution of the objective, can be observed on one instance of the problem with random starting points.

On \figurename{} \ref{alexandrov_res}, we show the evolution of the objective over 100 iterations with starting points for each \emph{design variable} randomly drawn over the interval [-100; 100]. We can see how the system converges towards the same optimum despite the wildly different initial conditions.

\section{Analysis of Academic Test Cases}

In this section we presented several academic test cases exhibiting classical properties of complex continuous optimization problems. We shown how the system was able to consistently converge on each test case toward an optimum solution, for multiple starting points.

Summarized results illustrating the convergence of the system. are presented on \tablename{} \ref{experiments_res}. The first group of values represents the number of evaluations which was needed for respectively 10\%, 50\% and 90\% of the instances to find the best solution. The second group represent the average distance to the best solution (truncated at $10^{-3}$) among all instances at different times (0\% being the start 100\% being the end of the solving in the worst case).

\begin{table}
\caption{Summary of experiments results for the tests cases}\label{experiments_res}

\begin{tabular}{cccc|cccc}

	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

These results tend to validate the correctness of our approach, proving that the conjunction of the agents nominal behaviors and cooperative mechanisms allows to solve correct solution to diverse optimization problems.

We will now present the second part of our validation, by making experiment on larger test cases in order to validate the system behavior on complex problem and to compare the performances of our system with other complex optimization methods.

\section{Optimization under Uncertainties}

While it is not the focus of our system, we worked with our partners of the ID4CS project to illustrate the uncertainties propagation capabilities presented in section \ref{mas_uncertainties}. To this end, we were provided with a preliminary aircraft design test case inspired from \cite{scholz2008preliminary}. The test case is declined into two versions: a deterministic optimization problem and an optimization problem under uncertainties.

The deterministic version is the following:

\begin{align*}
	\text{min }& f = \dfrac{2 g^3 L \sigma S_d}{C_L (A M^m {\sigma}^n \eta_{P,Cr} E)^2 \sigma (H)} \dfrac{1}{ \left( \dfrac{m_{MTO}}{S_W} \right) } \left(\dfrac{P_{TO}}{m_{MTO}}\right)^3  \\
	\text{s.t. } & g_1 = \dfrac{m_{MTO}}{S_W} - \dfrac{k_L \sigma C_{L, max, L} S_{LFL}}{ m_{ML}/m_{MTO}}\leq 0 \\
						&	g_2 = \dfrac{k_{TO} V g }{s_{TOFL} \sigma C_{L, max, TO} \eta_{P, TO}} - \dfrac{P_{TO}/m_{MTO}}{m_{MTO}/S_W} \leq 0\\
						&	g_3 = V_{CR}\dfrac{V_{md}}{E \eta_{P, CR} A M^m {\sigma}^n} \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi A e {\rho}_0 \sigma(H)g}{4 E_{max}}} - \dfrac{P_{TO}}{M_{MTO}} \sqrt{\dfrac{m_{MTO}}{S_W}} \leq \\
\end{align*}

where $\dfrac{m_{MTO}}{S_W}$ and $\dfrac{P_{TO}}{m_{MTO}}$ are the two design variables of the problem, representing respectively the power/mass ratio and the wing loading of the aircraft, and the other values are constants. The three constraints concern respectively the takeoff length, landing length and cruising speed. The solution to the deterministic problem is $\dfrac{m_{MTO}}{S_W} = 377$ and $\dfrac{P_{TO}}{m_{MTO}} = 187$, for $f = 2.15E+08$.

In the version with uncertainties, normal distribution laws are associated with some variables of the problem. The variables and associated uncertainties are shown in \tablename{} \ref{uncertainties_values}

\begin{table}
\caption{Uncertainties associated with the variables}\label{uncertainties_values}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Variable & Expected value & Standard deviation\\
\midrule
$C_{L,max,L}$			&	2.50		&	0.250	\\
$C_{L, max, TO}$	&	2.10		&	0.210	\\
$E$								&	12.49	&	1.249	\\
$\eta_{P, CR}$			&	0.86		&	0.086	\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The new objective is not to minimize $f$ but to minimize $E(f)$, the expected value of the function. The new constraints are $P(g_i \leq 0) \geq 0.9, \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$.

We slightly adapted our MAS to mimic a classical sequential optimization scheme. The basic idea of this type of method is to start by doing a deterministic optimization of the problem and, when the optimization has converged, to switch to an optimization under uncertainties using the deterministic solution point as a starting point. For our MAS, we instantiated this method by making the agents start doing a deterministic optimization. When a certain convergence condition is detected, the agents automatically switch to  optimization under uncertainties. A difference is that the system is not interrupted between the deterministic optimization and optimization under uncertainties. The agents handle the transition automatically by switching to uncertain values.

The solution to the problem under uncertainties is $\dfrac{m_{MTO}}{S_W} = 329$ and $\dfrac{P_{TO}}{m_{MTO}} = 244$

For the uncertainties propagations, the agents are provided with Monte-Carlo propagators. These propagators draw 50000 random values on the inputs following the uncertainties associated with each input, and return a set of points for each outputs. The constraints and objectives can directly use these sets of points, as explained in chapter \ref{mas_uncertainties}.

The trajectory of the system is shown on \figurename{} \ref{sequential_optim_fig}. The red dashed curves represent the deterministic constraints. The blue and green circles represent respectively the deterministic and robust solution points. The starting point (300, 300) is indicated by the letter S. We can see on the figure how, in the first part, the system converges toward the deterministic solution point and, on the second part, how it switches to uncertainties and changes its direction to converges on the robust solution point.

\section{Adaptation to Perturbations}

\subsection{Perturbated Alexandrov Problem}
 
On \figurename{} \ref{alexandrov_res_pert}, we can observe the reaction of the multi-agent system to a perturbation. During the solving of the previous experimentation on the problem, we changed the threshold of the constraint $s + l_1 \leq 1$ to $s + l_1 \leq -4$ (the change is indicated by a dotted line on the charts). The system dynamically adapts to the constraint changed and converges towards a new solution which satisfies the updated constraint.

	\caption{Turbofan agents behavior with perturbations (changes at dotted lines).}
	\label{turbofan_res_pert}
\end{figure*}


On \figurename{} \ref{turbofan_res_pert}, we illustrate the adaptation capabilities of the system by subjecting turbofan problem we introduced previously to a series of both strong and faster successive small changes to the problem topology (each perturbation is indicated by a dotted line). \\
First we create strong changes by modifying simultaneously both a constraint and the definition domain of $pi\_c$:
\begin{description}
\item[a.] $c1$ changed from $s <= 155$ to $s <= 165$, max bound of $pi\_c$ changed from 40 to 50
\item[b.] $c1$ changed from $s <= 165$ to $s <= 145$, max bound of $pi\_c$ changed from 50 to 30
\end{description}
 Then milder perturbations by only changing the definition domain of the variable:
\begin{description}
\item[c.] max bound of $pi\_c$ changed from 30 to 35
\item[d.] max bound of $pi\_c$ changed from 35 to 40
\item[e.] max bound of $pi\_c$ changed from 40 to 45
\end{description}
The experiments show that the system consistently reacts to these perturbations by adapting itself in order to find a new solution for the modified problem.

\chapter{Comparison with Existing Methods}

In this chapter we provide a comparison of our MAS with existing MDO methods. This comparison is based on the work of \cite{perez2004evaluation, Yi2008}. These two works are complementary as both of them concern a common subset of representative MDO methods: MDF, IDF, CSSO, BLISS and CO.

The work of \cite{perez2004evaluation} presents an analysis of these methods based on two test cases and rank them on multiple criteria: \emph{Accuracy, Efficiency, Transparency, Simplicity, Portability}.

The analysis of \cite{Yi2008} is based on different criteria, concentrating on the performances regarding the number of functions calls and the additional informations required by each methods. An interesting aspect of this comparison is that it provides several mathematical test cases on which the methods are applied.

For our evaluation we use test cases provided by both works and compare the performances of our system to the existing MDO methods. We then provide a comparison synthesis based on the criteria and analysis presented in \cite{perez2004evaluation}.

In order to obtain comparable results with MDO methods, we adopted a problem modeling based on the disciplines division proposed in these works. To this end, we considered that, for each test case, the natural formulation of the problem matched the proposed disciplines division. Consequently, for each test case, the mathematical models represented by our model agents correspond to the proposed disciplines.

\section{Comparison Criteria}

For our comparisons we use the criteria proposed in \cite{perez2004evaluation}, which are defined as follow:
\begin{compactitem}
\item \emph{Accuracy}: the quality of the solution proposed by the method, based on the distance between the proposed solution and the real optimal values.
\item \emph{Efficiency}: the computational cost to find the proposed solution, based on the number of disciplinary evaluations.
\item \emph{Simplicity}: the ease to instantiate and apply the method to different problems, based on the number of optimizers and variables required to implement the examples.
\item \emph{Transparency}: the capability to understand, modify or extend the method.
\item \emph{Portability}: the feasibility to apply the method in the context of an existing work organization, based on the distributivity capabilities of the method.
\end{compactitem}
 
The \emph{Accuracy} criterion reflects the aptitude of the method to find the input values corresponding to the optimum of the problem.
 
The \emph{Efficiency} criterion concerns the computational cost required by the method to provide its solution. When counting the number of evaluation calls, a distinction is made between discipline evaluations and full problem evaluations, the latter being considered considerably more costly than the former. Our MAS does not require any full problem evaluation, using only disciplines evaluations.
 
The \emph{Simplicity} criterion concerns the amount of work required to instantiate the method to suit different optimization problem. The original authors chose to evaluate this criterion using to measures: the number of optimizers involved and the number of additional variables required by the method.

The \emph{Transparency} criterion is the less well-defined and can be perceived as somewhat subjective. The original authors give as an example that \enquote{a probability-based method can be seamlessly integrated into a transparent formulation, which does not require major changes of the architecture to accomplish the integration.}

The \emph{Portability} criterion concerns the feasibility to integrate the method into an existing organizational structure. This evaluation criterion is based on the capabilities of the method to divide the concerns to match existing expert teams or specializations.

\section{Comparison Problem 1}

Our first comparison test case comes from \cite{perez2004evaluation}. It was originally introduced in \cite{sellar1996response} to study the performances of the CSSO method. Its formulation is the following:

\begin{align*}
\text{min }		&	f =x_2^2 + x_3 + y_1 + e^{-y_2}\\
\text{s.t. }			&	g_1 = \dfrac{y_1}{3.16} - 1 \geq 0\\ 
							&	g_2 = 1 - \dfrac{y_2}{24} \geq 0\\
\text{where }	&	y_1 = x_1^2 + x_2 + x_3 - 0.2y_2\\
							&	y_2 = \sqrt{y_1} + x_1 + x_3\\
\text{with }		& -10 \leq x_1 \leq 10\\
							& 0 \leq x_2, x_3 \leq 10
\end{align*}

The problem is divided into two disciples. The discipline 1 corresponds to the computation of $y_1$ and $g_1$, while the discipline 2 corresponds to the computation of  $y_2$ and $g_2$. The authors use the same initial points $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 5$, $x_3 = 2$ for each analysis. The optimum for this problem is located at $x_1 = 1.9776$, $x_2 = 0$, $x_3 = 0$, for which the value of $f$ is $3.1834$.

We present here the comparison of our method with the ones evaluated in \cite{perez2004evaluation}, based on the different comparison criteria. The authors originally compared the MDF, IDF, CSSO, CO and BLISS methods. We reproduce their results here and add our method to the comparisons under the term \textbf{AMAS}.

Regarding the simplicity criterion, the relevant measures are shown in \tablename{} \ref{bench1_simplicity}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Comparison Problem 1 -- Simplicity}\label{bench1_simplicity}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Method & No. Optimizers & Additional variables\\
\midrule
MDF					&	1	&	0	\\
IDF						&	1	&	2	\\
CSSO					& 3	&	3	\\
CO						&	3	&	9	\\
BLISS					&	3	&	3	\\
\textbf{AMAS}	&	2	&	0	\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In regard of the transparency criterion, the authors in \cite{perez2004evaluation} note that MDF and IDF are the most transparent, as the mathematical models and objectives are easily formulated and modified. The CO method requires a little more attention in the formulation of the disciplinary objectives. CSSO and BLISS are the more complex, needing respectively approximation models and a sensitivity analysis.\\
Our method, as MDF can be directly derived from the analytical expression of the problem, without requiring further work from the expert. However, as the problem is divided in two disciplines, it will require two optimizers.

Concerning the portability criterion, the authors note that  MDF and IDF, being centralized methods, are not flexible and cannot adapt to existing organizational structures. CO, CSSO and BLISS on the other hand can be adapted to existing organization or distributed computing requirements. However CSSO requires not only for each discipline to provide an approximation of their state but need also an entire system analysis at each iteration. BLISS requires additional calculations to calculate the sensitivities of the disciplines.\\
Our method is similar to CO, CSSO and BLISS as the experts can choose how to divide the problem to match the organization of the disciplinary groups, without imposing additional requirements concerning the formulation of the problem. It is also naturally distributable, as each agent is an independent process.

In regard of the efficiency, the number of evaluations for each methods is detailed in \tablename{} \ref{bench1_efficiency}.

Note that in our case, the rounding is done at a lower precision than in the other test cases. This is voluntary to illustrate the fact that the constraint $y_2$ is actually violated, but this violation is lower than the rounding decimal, as per the criticality mechanism of constraint agents we explained in \ref{conflicting_requests_mechanism}.

\section{Comparison Problem 2}

For our second comparison test case, we selected one of the problems presented in  \cite{Yi2008}\footnote{the original authors originally introduced two additional variables $z_1^{nc}$ and $z_2^{nc}$. However these variables had no impact on the problem in itself, consequently we did not reproduce them here}:

\begin{align*}
\text{min }		&	f =(z_1 - 0.5)^2  + (z_2 - 0.5)^2\\
\text{s.t. }			&	g_1 = 1.0 -  z_1 \leq 0\\ 
							&	g_2 = 1.0 -  z_2 \leq 0\\ 
\text{where }	& z_1 = (b_1 - 2.5) + (b_c -2.0) -0.5z_2\\
							& z_2 = (b_2 - 3.5) + (b_c -2.0) -0.7z_1\\
\end{align*}

The problem is divided into two disciplines, the first one corresponding to the computation of $z_1$ and $g_1$, while the second one corresponds to the computation of $z_2$ and $g_2$.

We did not include MDOIS in the comparisons, as it is a specialized method applicable only to specific problem topologies, and not a general MDO method (see section \ref{MDOIS_desc}). On \tablename{} \ref{bench2_simplicity} is shown the number of design variables and additional equality constraint for each method.

Sadly, the authors did not provide the starting points they used for evaluating the number of evaluations of the different methods. Consequently we cannot provide a meaningful comparison of our method on this criterion. For our experiments, we choose to make 100 instances of the problem, with random starting value for the variables drawn between -100 and 100. As an indication, the median number of evaluations for the disciplines required by our method to find the solution is indicated in \tablename{} \ref{bench2_efficiency}. In \tablename{} \ref{bench2_accuracy} we show the median value obtained over all the experiments for $f$.

\section{Comparison Synthesis}
 
Here we present a synthesis of the comparison between our system and existing MDO methods.

On \tablename{} \ref{comparison_synthesis}, we reproduce the analysis of \cite{perez2004evaluation} and add our own method (indicated as \textbf{AMAS}) to the comparison. Note that the classification of the existing MDO methods is based on the original work.

In regard of the accuracy criterion, our method provides good results, consistently converging toward the optimum in both benchmarks. We classed it under MDF, as our method still need to be provided with a precision, and allow for constraint violation under this precision. 

In regard of the efficiency criterion, our method is on part with the most efficient MDO methods.Moreover, our experiments were done using only the agents internal optimization mechanisms. Even better results could be expected if the agents were provided with adequate external optimizers.

In regard of the simplicity criterion, for the number of objectives, our method requires $n$ optimizers ($n$ being the number of models involved). In this regard it is less efficient than MDF and IDF, which only require 1 optimizer, but is better than the other methods which require $n+1$ optimizers (1 by model plus 1 global optimizer). For the number of additional variables, our method in on par with MDF, the best method in regard of this measure, as neither of them require any additional variable.\\
The only method dominating our own in regard of this criterion is MDF. Our method can be considered on part with IDF, as neither of them dominate the other on both measures.

In regard of the transparency criterion, we have shown that our approach was modular and extensible, due to the distribution of roles between the agents and to the explicitly encapsulation of mathematical tools (analytical models, external optimizers). We demonstrated this modularity with the addition of uncertainty propagation mechanisms into the MAS.

In regard of the portability criterion, our method is extremely flexible as it support multiple levels of modeling and multiple reformulations of the problem. Consequently the problem can be \enquote{tailored} to fit the existing organizational structure. Contrary to the MDO methods, our method does not require a \emph{central} authority as the responsibility to maintaining consistency is distributed in the system.

\chapter{Evaluating Scalability Performances using Generated Test Cases}

\section{Generated Problem Graphs}

In this section we present some measures we established in regard of the scalability performances of our MAS. For this part of the experiments we were not concerned with the optimization performances of the system, but more with its capability to handle large agent graphs without suffering from performances degradation.

\subsection{Generating NDMO Agent Graphs}

In order to realize our experiments, we required a large number of test cases of several sizes and comparable complexity. Since such repository of continuous optimization problems is not readily available, we worked on a way to automatically generate them. To this end, we took advantage of the fact that, as demonstrated with our NDMO modeling, an optimization problem can be represented as a graph. Consequently it is possible to use well-known graph generation techniques and directly generate problem graphs.

We propose a very simple method to generate simple problem graphs. First we use a graph generation algorithm to generate a directed graph of size $n$. The nodes of this graph represent the variables of the problem and the arcs their dependencies. If a node is not the head of any arc (\emph{i.e.} there is no arc going to this node), it is a design variable, otherwise it is an output variable.\\
The next step is to insert models. As we stated, the optimization problem in itself is of little importance in this part. Consequently our only requirement for the model is that they must be able to take an arbitrary number of inputs and produce one output. In our experiments we used a simple \emph{Sum} function. For each output variable, we insert a node representing the model in the graph. The links going to the output variable node are redirected to the model node, and a link going from the model node to the output node is create.\\
After this step, criteria are randomly added to variable nodes. In our experiments, we given a 20\% probability of a variable node to be linked to a criterion, with half the chance for the criterion to be an objective and half the change for it to be a constraint. Once more, in order to simplify the problem generation, all objectives are about minimizing the variable, and are constraints are about having the variable higher of equal to zero.

The generation method is summarized in \ref{algo_graph_generation}. After all these steps, the graph is a valid NDMO graph and can be directly transformed into an agent graph.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Problem graph generation}
\label{algo_graph_generation}
	$n \leftarrow$ initialization number\;
	$G(nodes, arcs) \leftarrow GraphGenerator(n)$\;
			
		\ForEach{$currentNode \in G.nodes$}{
			tag($currentNode$, \enquote{variable})\;
			$enteringArcs \leftarrow \{arc \in G.arcs, isHeadOf(arc, currentNode)\}$\;
			\If{$enteringArcs \neq \emptyset$}{
				\tcp{$currentNode$ is an output variable}
				$modelNode \leftarrow $ new node\;
				tag($modelNode$, \enquote{model})\;
				$G$.add($modelNode$)\;
				$G$.createArcBetween($modelNode$, $currentNode$)\;
				\ForEach{$arc \in enteringArcs$}{
					$tailNode \leftarrow arc.tail$\;
					$G$.removeArc($arc$)\;
					$G$.createArcBetween($tailNode$, $modelNode$)\;
				}
			}
			\;
			\tcp{check for criteria}			
			$rand \leftarrow drawRandomNumber()$\;		
			\If{$rand \leq	 criteriaProba$}{		
				$critNode \leftarrow$ new node\;
				$G$.createArcBetween($currentNode$, $critNode$)\;
				\eIf{$rand \leq drawRandomNumber/2$}{
					tag($critNode$, \enquote{objective})\;				
				}{
					tag($critNode$, \enquote{constraint})\;
				}
			}		
		}

\end{algorithm}

It must be noted that the final size of problems generated by this algorithm is not fixed, and can be significantly larger than the initialization value $n$. However problems produced using the same initialization number and the same graph generator are of comparable sizes.

We used graph generators proposed by the GraphStream library \footnote{\url{http://www.graphstream-project.org/}}. On \figurename{} \ref{graph_generation_examples} some examples of graphs produced using these generators are visualized using GraphStream visualization tools. It should be noted that, because of the modifications we apply on the graph after it is created using the generator, the final agent graph does not necessarily respect the properties of the initial graph , however we can see on \figurename{} \ref{graph_generation_examples} that, the modifications we apply do not radically modify the characteristic topologies of the different graph types.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental Results}

Before discussing the results we obtained, let us add a word of warning concerning measuring real-time performances of java applications (java being the programming language used to implement our prototype). The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which executes java programs, applies a lot of complex optimization steps \emph{during} the execution process. Consequently making some precise and non-biased measurements can be hazardous.\\
Regarding our experiments, we tried to mitigate possible bias by taking the two following precautions:
\begin{compactitem}
\item before running the measured experiments, running multiple problems whose results were discarded, in order to \enquote{heat} the JVM and allowing it to apply its optimization procedures beforehand.
\item running the different experiments multiple times and in different orders, to \enquote{spread} the benefits of possible optimizations happening at runtime.
\end{compactitem}
We believe that these precautions are sufficient to obtain sufficiently meaningful results. Nevertheless, the reader should be warned not to consider the presented values as exact measurements of the system performances.

On \figurename{} \ref{time_by_size_perfo} are presented the results of the execution time of problems of different sizes. We generated agent graphs of different sizes using both Small-World and Random Euclidean algorithms. On the figure are presented the median time needed for all the agents of the problem to execute 800 behavior cycle. Interestingly, while the time performances in regard of small-world based problems graphs increase linearly with the size of the problems, the time needed in the case of random problem graphs seems to increase exponentially.

\begin{figure}
\centering

	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{R_figs/graph_problems/time_by_size_watts_strogatz}
		\caption{Small-World graphs.}\label{time_by_size_perfo:ws}

		\caption{Random Euclidean graphs.}\label{time_by_size_perfo:re}
	\end{subfigure}

\caption{Time performances by MAS size.}\label{time_by_size_perfo}
\end{figure}

This seemingly poor performance can however easily be explained by looking at \figurename{} \ref{degree_by_size}, on which are shown the median degree (that is, the number of arcs entering of exiting a node) of the nodes in each generated problems. We can see, that, whatever the size of the problem, the median degree of a node in Small-World problems is mostly constant. However, in the case of Random Euclidean graphs, the median degree increases linearly with the size of the problem. Consequently, the exponential increase in time regarding Random Euclidean graphs can be explained by the conjugated effects of the increase in number of agents and the increase of the neighborhood size of the agents (whose impact in the behavior algorithm complexity has been exposed in section \ref{NCS_pres}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{R_figs/graph_problems/degree_by_size_comparison}
\caption{Comparison of nodes median degree by graph type.}\label{degree_by_size}
\end{figure}

In order to corroborate this analysis, we studied the impact increasing the nodes degree has on the execution time of the MAS. On \figurename{} \ref{experiment_degrees}, we show the results of another experiment using agent graphs generated using a Barabasi-Albert generator, which has the advantage of being able to easily generate graphs with different median degree sizes at the cost of only a slight increase of node numbers. On the figure is shown the average time for all the agents to make a behavior cycle in function of the median degree of the agents (using Barabasi-Albert based graphs of sizes between 510 and 550 nodes). We can see that the neighborhood size of the agents (the degree of the node) has the predicted effect on the time needed by the agents to execute their behavior.

	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Time performances by node degree.}
\label{experiment_degrees}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis of Performances}

Overall, we can conclude by observing these results that the time required for the agents to make a behavior cycle is not meaningfully impacted by the size of the problem. This property is an expected benefit of restricting the agents to local perception and decision process.\\
The results also shown the impact of increasing the neighborhood size of the agents. The time increase correspond to the analysis we made concerning the computational complexity of the agent behavior (in \ref{NCS_pres}). This analysis illustrates once more the importance of maintaining the behavior of the agents at a local level. Had the agent decision process involved not only its immediate neighbors, but also a large group of agent, the computational cost would have increased even more sharply with the size of the problem.\\
As a remark, let us add that our implementation of the agent behavior was far from optimal from a performances point of view. In order to modify and experiment more easily on the agents, we voluntary kept separated into distinct modules the different solving mechanism of the agents. A more efficient implementation could factor several of the treatments in order to reduce the computational complexity, obtaining a non-negligible performances improvement in the process.

\section{Springs Networks}

The automated agents graphs we detailed in the previous sections are useful to study raw scalability performances on different problem sizes. They are limited, however, by the fact that the problems they represent are meaningless. Consequently this kind of automated graphs are not useful to study the performances of the system in regard to the convergence toward a correct solution.

In this section, we propose a method to automatically generate another kind of problems graphs. The idea is to use graphs representing springs networks, where the edges linking the vertices represent springs whose extremities are tied together. Some of the nodes are fixed to arbitrary positions, while the goal of the problem is to find the position of the free nodes for which the spring network is stable, that is, where all the tensions of the springs connected to a node are at an equilibrium.\\
The interest of such problem is that the springs network can be generated using classical graph generator algorithms, and that there is a unique (as long as at least one node has a fixed position) and easily verifiable solution.

\subsection{Representing Springs Networks with NDMO}

A major difference with the previous generated problems is that, in the case of the springs networks, the generated graph does not represent directly the agents graph. We must propose a NDMO modeling of the springs network in order to be able to apply our method.

The springs networks can be represented in 1, 2 or even more dimensions, each additional dimension adding a new coordinate for the position of the nodes. Interestingly, each dimension is independent in the sense that the strengths applied by the springs to the nodes can be computed independently. Consequently the agents graph representing a spring network in n dimensions will be composed of n independant connected components.

We present here the procedure to generate the NDMO graph for springs of one dimension, which can easily be generalized to n dimensions:
\begin{compactitem}
\item First of all the springs network is generated using a given graph generator.
\item Each spring (\emph{i.e.} the edges of the graph) is given a random tension strength. In our experiments the tension strengths were drawn randomly between 1 and 100.
\item Each node has a random chance of becoming a fixed node (in our experiments this probability was fixed to 0.3). If the node is fixed, its current coordinate is set as a constant value.
\item For each free node, a variable agent is created, representing its coordinate.
\item For each spring linked to at least one free node, a model agent is created, representing the current tension of the spring based on its initial tension and the coordinates of the nodes to which the spring is linked. The exact computations for calculating the tension strength of a spring is shown on \figurename{} \ref{springs_model}. This model takes in input the value of the variable agents of the linked nodes (if one of the node is fixed, its coordinate is used as a constant). For each model agent, an output agent is created representing the output value of the model.
\item For each variable agent, a model agent is created, representing the sum of the spring strengths applied to the node. This model agent takes in input the output agents representing the strengths applied by the linked springs.
\item For each of these model agents, an output agent is created. To this output agent is linked a constraint agent representing the constraint that the value of this output must be equal to 0 when the springs strengths are at equilibrium.
\end{compactitem}


\begin{figure}
[[TODO - put formula]]
\caption{Sum of springs strengths model computation.}\label{springs_model}
\end{figure}

The generation procedure is synthesized in algorithm \ref{algo_springs}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Springs network problem generation}

	$n \leftarrow$ initialization number\;
	$G(nodes, edges) \leftarrow GraphGenerator(n)$\;

			\eIf{$e_i.n_1$ is free}{

			}{

			}
			\eIf{$e_i.n_2$ is free}{

			}{

		}
	}

		\;
		\tcp{create constraint}
		$c_i \leftarrow$ new constraint agent\;
		link($s_i$, $c_i$)\;
	}
\end{algorithm}

An example of transformation is presented on \figurename{} \ref{springs_example}. On \figurename{} \ref{springs_example:springs} is shown a simple springs network with a fixed node A and two free nodes B and C. The nodes are linked by edges 1 and 2. The corresponding agents graph (for one dimension) is shown on \figurename{} \ref{springs_example:agents}.\\
Notice how, since the node A is fixed, the model $tension_1$ only takes the coordinate of B in input. It can also be seen that, since B is linked to two springs, the model $sum_B$, representing the sum of strengths applied to B, takes two values as inputs while, since C is linked to only one spring, $sum_C$ only takes one input.

\subsection{Springs Networks Experiments}

In this section we study the impact of the problem size on the convergence speed of the system. To this end we created 2D springs networks generated with the previously detailed procedure, using Small-World graph generators to obtain graphs of different sizes. In each instance we executed the system until it found the correct solution (\emph{i.e.} the positions of the nodes for which the system is at equilibrium). On \figurename{} \ref{springs_res} is shown the result of our experiments. Each dot corresponds to a problem instance, with the agents number and the number of evaluations required to find the correct solution. We also show the linear regression trend line corresponding to the data set as a red dotted line.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{/R_figs/graph_problems/springs}
\caption{Number of evaluations required by agents number}\label{springs_res}
\end{figure}

We can see that, while the number of evaluations can vary greatly for two instances of similar sizes, the number of agents has a relatively low impact on the convergence time of the system. These two observations are consistent with our previous analysis, confirming that the convergence is greatly impacted by the topology of the problem, but that the system is able to scale with the size of the problem.

\section*{Analysis of Experiments and Future Works}

In this part we presented several of the experiments we did on our system. These experiments show the validity of our agents behaviors on classical optimization problems, as well as the good performances of our system compared to other complex problems optimization methods. We also demonstrated the adaptation capabilities of our system, as well as its extensibility using uncertainties.\\
Using automatically generated problems, we were able to study the scalability properties of our system, and the impact of various criteria on its performances. The observations we made were coherent with our analysis of the agents behaviors.

Of course, the results presented in this part can only show a limited view of our system. For this reason, we continue our experiments in the different categories of test cases we have presented.\\
New academics test cases are experimented upon in order to detect potential new NCSs. In the context of the ID4CS project, we are currently in a validation phase using real-world large optimization problems, provided by our industrial partners (such as the one illustrated on \figurename{} \ref{test_case_airbus}).\\
We also continue to work on new ways to experiments on optimization under uncertainties using different optimization schemes. Simultaneously, we continue our comparison work by applying our system on additional benchmark test cases.\\
At last, we have seen that the scalability properties of the system are influenced by the topology of the agents graph. For this reason we pursue our scalability experiments on generated test cases, using addition graph generation algorithms in order to study more in depth the effects of the different criteria.
