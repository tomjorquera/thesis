Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are 

MAS, based on a constructivist paradigm, have appeared as a convincing 

During the last ten years, the scientific community has relentlessly pursued the effort to bridge the gap between these two apparently irreconcilable approaches. The goal of this thesis is to contribute to this effort by addressing a mostly unexplored application field of MAS: continuous optimization.



\section*{Manuscript Organisation}
This thesis is divided into 4 parts:
\begin{enumerate}[P{a}rt I.] %the {a} avoids this letter to be used as the counter (the I is used instead)
\item This part introduces the context of the study by presenting an overview of the continuous optimization field, MAS for optimization and the Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems theory.
\item This part presents the contribution of this thesis: a MAS for solving continuous optimization problems. We propose a modeling of a continuous optimization problem as an agent graph, and describe some cooperative behaviors for the different agent roles.
\item [[TODO: depends on CPSP chapter]].
\item In this part we present the experiments we did in order to evaluate and validate our approach.
