\part{Design, Implementation and Contribution Toward AMAS4Opt}

One of our concerns was not only to propose a new approach for continuous optimization, but also to put this approach in practice by integrating it into a proof-of-concept prototype. To this end we worked with domain specialists and software development experts to propose such a tool, basing ourselves upon the ADELFE method. This method aims to guide the development of AMAS-based softwares from high level user requirements to the implementation nuts and bolts. Using ADELFE we made a formal analysis of the domain and actor involved in the use of such tool.

We also use the design tools developed in conjunction with the method to instantiate our MAS with the final end to integrate it with a functional end-user interface. Notably, the recent MAY framework, which was developed in order to provide suitable abstractions as well as reusable software components for the development of agents and multi-agents systems. We contributed to the enrichment of its component library by developing a a general and modular agent architecture consistent with the AMAS theory, in particular by proposing a modular skill stack principle, where different skills can be composed to address specific requirements.

While such work could seems to concerns more software engineering experts than computer scientists, we will see how existing MAS oriented methods such as ADELFE are still too broad level to be successfully directly applied to any domain (and more so to continuous optimization) without an important agent expertise and extensive research work. We will detail how the scientific work we produced and presented in the previous part, especially the identification of various NCS and the mechanisms to solve them, can be generalized into \enquotes{building blocks}. These building blocks could be then reused to guide the conception of other MAS for the domain of problem solving. This work places itself into a more general effort to provide a general reusable toolbox for assisting non experts in applying AMAS to the domain of optimization, under the name \emph{AMAS4Opt} (AMAS for Optimization).

\section{Overview of ADELFE}

In section \ref{AMAS-ADELFE}, we succinctly presented ADELFE\footnote{\url{http:/www.irit.fr/ADELFE/}}, the method which has been proposed for the design of AMAS. In this chapter we get back in more details about this method and what benefits it provided for the design of our system. 

ADELFE is a method devoted to software engineering of adaptive multi-agent systems, developed by ARTAL and IRIT and founded by the RNTL 2000 program. The name “ADELFE” is the French acronym for "toolkit to develop software with emergent functionality" (Atelier pour le DEveloppement de Logiciels à Fonctionnalité Emergente.

The ADELFE method in itself is based the Rational Unifed Process (RUP) and is defined following the Software Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM)  \cite{bernon2003adelfe,picard04phdthesis}. Since its revision \cite{Ro2008.3}, it is composed of five \emph{Work Definitions} ($WD$), themselves decomposed in several \emph{activities} making use of UML as well as the AMAS-ML and muADL languages. An overview of the method is shown on \figurename{} \ref{ADELFE_phases}.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{AdelfePhases}
\caption{Overview of the ADELFE Method}\label{ADELFE_phases}
\end{figure}

In regard of the RUP, ADELFE adds specific activities and roles which are specific to its approach for the design of AMAS.\\
The final requirement study ($WD_2$), was complemented with activities 6 and 7-2 concerning the characterization of the system environment and the identification of cooperation failures during the determining of the use cases.During the Analysis ($WD_3$), additional activities 11 and 12 respectively check for the adequacy of AMAS to the problem and identify the agents involved in the system being built, while activity 13 is complemented with a step concerning the study of the relationships between agents. During the design ($WD_4$), activities 15 et 16 concerns the design of the system and the agents, while activity 17 concerning fast prototyping was added in order to be able to quickly test the proposed behavior of the agents. The development phase ($WD5$), which was not present in the initial version of ADELFE, concerns the architecture and the implementation of the agents and the system.

\section{Applying ADELFE for the Design of a Continuous Optimization Tool}

Based on the guidelines of the ADELFE methodology we defined the requirements of the tool we proposed to develop. The following functionalities were identified:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Our tool will allows users to solve multidisciplinary optimization problems.
\item  The user will be able to load disciplinary models into the tool, express some constraints and objectives on these models and then use and interact with the tool to solve the defined problem.
\item Our tool will be reusable from one optimization problem to another in different application domains and will be a generic tool.
\item The user will be able to specify a specific resolution process to be used, but it will not be mandatory.
\item The user will be able to load into the tool different models of the same discipline (i.e. aerodynamics, acoustics ...), but with a different fidelity. It will be possible for the user to specify the tool to take in account these different models during the problem solving.
\item The user will be able to express uncertainties on some part of the models or input variables.
\item The resolution will take into account these uncertainties.
\item The tool will be able to integrate some well-known optimization techniques, and will allow the user to add new techniques to use during solving. The tool will also be able to interact with others optimization tools to ease the optimization process.

\item The user will be able (at runtime):
	\begin{compactitem}
    \item to monitor the system activity,
    \item to observe time history qualitative indicators,
    \item to adjust its parameters.
    \end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{Use_cases}
\caption{Actors and use cases identified during requirements studies}\label{Use_cases}
\end{figure}

Several entities interacting with the tool were also identified. The \emph{Method expert} adds new optimization methods into the system. The expert field can be optimization methods (classic methods, AMAS methods ...) or uncertainties. The \emph{Model expert} adds new models into the system. The role of the \emph{Engineer} is to use the different elements defined by the other experts to define new problem for the system to solve and to monitor the functioning of the system. At last, the \emph{AMAS expert} has to define and tune the agents of the system. The system should also be able to integrate with external optimization and modeling tool, in order to accommodate the existing workflow and constraints of the users.

The different use cases which were identified for each of these entities are presented in \figurename{} \ref{Use_cases}.

The domain analysis (activity 10) roughly correspond to the work we provided in \ref{modeling}, as this activity correspond to the study of the application domain in interaction with the domain experts. Without entering too much into the technicalities, the domain modeling roughly corresponds to an extended version of NDMO, with some additions and adjustments regarding the expected functionalities of the prototype.\\
ADELFE then advocates an AMAS adequacy verification (activity 11), in which one checks using a set of questions if AMAS are a relevant solution for the problem to solve. We discussed in lengths in chapter \ref{AMAS_chapter} the advantages of the AMAS approach. Without much surprise the results of this activity were strongly in favor of using an AMAS solution, as the problem we aim to solve  is highly distributed, is not easily solvable by known algorithms, is potentially non-linear and evolving.

The next activities concerned the design of the agents themselves, their interactions, the identification and solving of the Non Cooperative Situations. The work concerning these activities is without much doubt the most difficult and hazardous, involving in the ADELFE method the participation of an \enquote{agent designer}. Indeed, this part of the ADELFE method stays at a high abstraction level, and we can say without much controversy that the process of designing the agents is still highly exploratory, probably currently more related to a scientific study than to a engineering development. In this regard, our contribution presented in part \ref{MAS4Optim_part} provides the expected answers to these activities.

The last WD of ADELFE corresponds to the design of the agent architecture and implementation using MAY, the component-based framework developed in complement of ADELFE. While such framework aims ultimately to make the process as seamless and  automated than possible by providing reusable components, its early state implied once more some exploratory work on our part in order to produce, and in the end contribute to the MAy library with our own produced components. We will now see in the next chapter the architecture we proposed for a modular AMAS agent design.

\chapter{MAY Architecture}

To implement the MAS, we used the Make Agents Yourself (MAY) framework  \cite{No2012.2}. MAY is a component-based framework which automatically generate an implementation of an agent architecture from a given description.

\section{Agent Architecture}

The ADELFE methodology proposes an abstract agent architecture (represented in \figurename{} \ref{AMAS-ML_agent}), which we translated into the MAY architecture description language, SpeADL. In the context of our study, as the agents communicate and interact only by message transmission we could make some simplifications in regard of the original modeling of communications and actions capability of the agents. All our agents use the same AMAS architecture. They are differentiated by specific implementations of the components. For example, \emph{Model} and \emph{Variable} agents will have different implementations of the \emph{Behavior} component.\\
The components of a MAY architecture are connected by \emph{ports}. A port can be though as a service interface, listing a set of available operations. Components expose lists of available and required ports. A component necessitate its required ports must be linked to available ports satisfying these interface provided by other components.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{amasmlAgent}
\caption{AMAS agent architecture (as defined in ADELFE)}\label{AMAS-ML_agent}
\end{figure}

An illustration of this composition mechanism is shown on \figurename{} \ref{Speadl_example}. Two components $A$ and $B$ are present. The component $A$ exposes a port $P$ as available, which is required and used by the component $B$. Consequently, this last component is now able to call the operations declared by $A$ through this port, operations which are supposedly necessary for the good functioning of $B$. The way ports are used to connect otherwise independent components is in this way not too dissimilar to the role interfaces play in the context of \emph{dependency injection} design pattern.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Speadl_example}
\caption{Example of MAY composition}\label{Speadl_example}
\end{figure}

For the sake of clarity, the agent architecture is separated in three views: the \emph{behavior}, \emph{communication} and \emph{monitoring} views.

\subsection{Behavior}

The \emph{behavior} view (\figurename{} \ref{Arch-behavior}) contains the components related to the behavior of the agent. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\paperwidth]{ID4CS_Speadl_behav}
\caption{Agent Architecture - Behavior view.}
\label{Arch-behavior}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Behavior} component contains the rules which dictate the behavior of the agent. This component can be seen as the [[chef d'orchestre]] of the architecture. This component exposes to the outside of the environment the \emph{Step} port, which is used to make the agent execute a step. During a step the \emph{Behavior} component executes the agent rules. These rules will in return make use of the others components of the agent.

it is this behavior component contains the behavioral algorithm presented in part \ref{MAS4Optim_part}. This component mostly contains the parts regarding the general steps of the agent behavior and making use of the more specialized methods  implemented in the \emph{Skills} and \emph{Aptitudes} components (for example, the exact computations involved in the detection of NCS).

The \emph{State Vault} contains the state of the agent. It is used by the components which need to save and read some state variables. Centralizing all the states variables into one component provides several benefits. First it is easier to save and restore the state of the agent, as we just need to save the content of the vault. It is also simple to share some data between components, as long as these components have access to the vault. And it is easy to provide a view of the agent state by just reading the State Vault.\\
This approach has however several drawbacks. It adds some boilerplate code when writing code using the agent state, as we need to explicitly read the value from the vault (and possibly store it to the vault if modified). It make more difficult to track side-effects, as it is not obvious to know which component uses which value. At last there is sadly no way to strictly enforce that components only use the State Vault for storing state values, as neither Java nor MAY can provide such guarantee.

The \emph{Skills} component contains the skills of the agents. Each agent type has its own skills set, and skills can require to read and modify the agent state (thus the link between this component and the \emph{State Vault}). Some skills are used directly from the \emph{Behavior} rules but some skills can also be used by others skills.\\
Some examples of skills are: for a \emph{Variable agent}, the capability to change its value based on the requests it received and its old value. For a model agent, the capability to translate a request it received to change one of its outputs into a set of requests to send to its inputs.\\
Skills have the somewhat unique properties that they are in themselves stackable, depending on each others. To address this concerns we proposed to define the \emph{Skills} component itself as a complete components architecture in itself. We discuss this point in more details in \ref{Skills_component}.

The \emph{Aptitudes} component contains the aptitudes accessible to the agents. Unlike skills, aptitudes are general capabilities which do not rely on the state of the agent. Consequently, all agent types have access to the same aptitudes, and there is only one implementation of the \emph{Aptitudes} component.\\
Some aptitudes are used directly from the \emph{Behavior} rules but some aptitudes can also be used by skills or others aptitudes.
Some examples of aptitudes are: ordering a set of requests from the most to the least important. Make some manipulations on the potentially complex exchanged values (adding, calculate the norm etc., used for example in the manipulation of uncertain values).

The distinction between \emph{skills} and \emph{aptitudes} is not an easy one. The ADELFE method make the distinction between the two concept by defining skills to be inherent capabilities of the agents which cannot be abstracted from the application domain (for example the way a variable agent 
changes it value in response to the requests it receives), while aptitudes are more general capabilities which could be reused between distinct systems (for example, using an Adaptive Value Tracker to track a value). The distinction between the two can be somewhat fuzzy, even more are often the firsts can depend on the seconds (for example, as a part of the skill concerning the change of its value, the variable agent will use an AVT).\\
In our implementation, we choose to address this concern by classifying as skills the capabilities of the agents which are related (by using or modifying) the internal state of the agent, while classifying as aptitudes the capabilities which require no such things. Hence the distinction in our component modeling where the \emph{Skills} component requires an access to the internal state of the agent, while this requirement is absent from the \emph{Aptitudes} agent.

\subsubsection*{Skills Component Architecture}\label{Skills_component}

As stated, one of the more complex components of the agents is the one which encapsulate its skills. Indeed, each agent type has its own specific skills, and the skills in themselves can intervene at different level or even be used by other skills. This specificity justifies the implementation of the internals of the \emph{Skills} component itself as component architecture. As skills are, by definition, specific to the application domain this modeling concerns more the explicit handling of the dependencies between \enquotes{skillsets} than the reuse of the components. However, as some skills, while being specific to our application, are shared by several agent types. Based on the agent class diagram presented in \figurename{} \ref{SMA_class_diagram}, we derived the skills components tree presented in \figurename{} \ref{skills:graph}. As an example, \figurename{} \ref{skills:example} shows the composition of the \emph{Skills} component of a model agent.  As a remark, we see on the left figure that variable and output agents share the same skills. This pragmatic choice comes from the fact that, since the user can act on the problem at any time, a variable agent can become an output agent and \emph{vice versa}.

This tree-like structure of the skills components is not only a good way from engineering point of view a good way to factor implementation code, but is also efficient in regard of the functioning of NCS. As different NCS are shared by different agent types at different levels, this organization enable an efficient representation of which cooperative behavior is common to which agents.

\subsection{Communication}

The \emph{communication} view (\figurename{} \ref{Arch-comm}) presents the components related to the communication capabilities of the agent. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\paperwidth]{ID4CS_Speadl_comm}
\caption{Agent Architecture - Communication view.}
\label{Arch-comm}
\end{figure}

This view contains the new component \emph{Message Box}, which contains the messages sent to the agent. The \emph{Message Box} stores the messages into the \emph{State Vault} and provides a direct access to the \emph{Skills} and {Behavior} components.

This figure presents several ports which need to be provided from the environment to the agent. The environment must give an unique \emph{Reference} to the agent, which will be used by the others agent to communicate with it. The environment must also provides some ports to communicate with the others agents and outside of the system.
[[PARLER DE L'AGENT FINDER ??]]

\subsection{Monitoring}

The \emph{monitoring} view (\figurename{} \ref{Arch-monitor}) presents the components related to the monitoring of the agent. 

The new component introduced in this view is the \emph{Monitor}. The \emph{Monitor} provides to the environment to ports. The first port is used for external monitoring interfaces to subscribe to be informed of changes in the state of the agent. The second is used to provide informations concerning changes of a specific part of the agent. Thus, an external monitoring interface can subscribe to be notified when the state of the agent changed using the first port, and then use the second port to access to the specific informations it want to monitor.

In order to provide its capabilities, the monitor agent need to be informed by the \emph{Behavior} component before and after each step, to read and compare the monitored informations into the \emph{State Vault}.

\section{MAS Architecture}

\section{Integration into the prototype}

[[OSGI and EMF]]

This implementation of the MAS was part of a collective development effort to provide a functional prototype. The goal of this prototype is to be a proof-of-concept tool of the possibilities offered by agent-based continuous optimization.

The development of the prototype was carried mainly by three partners[[cite them?]], each in charge of a different aspect.

The prototype can be divided in three parts: The Graphical User Interface (GUI), the core module (CORE) and the Multi-Agent Système (MAS). The CORE provides a common representation of the manipulated data and is in charge of maintaining consistency between the GUI and the MAS.

These three modules communicate using the OSGi framework\footnote{\url{http://www.osgi.org}}.

\subsection{MAS}

We already presented the implementation of the MAS in the previous parts. The only additional work was to encapsulate the implementation into an OSGi [[service]].

\subsection{CORE}

The CORE module is responsible of maintaining consistency of the manipulated data. It serves as a middle-man between the MAS and the GUI.

[[Insert full Data Model and comment]]

\subsection{GUI}

The GUI was build using the [[Eclipse Framework]].
