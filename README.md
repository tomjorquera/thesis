An Adaptive Multi-Agent System for Self-Organizing Contunuous Optimization
==========================================================================

This repository contains the source files of my PhD thesis in Artificial Intelligence, which I successfully defended in October 2013.

Description
-----------
The project is composed of the following folders:

* `generated` -- contains files automatically created by LaTeX (created by build script)
* `hooks` -- contains scripts executed by the VCS
* `libs` -- LaTeX library files used for the document
* `scripts` -- various scripts I created in an attempt to procrastinate on my thesis
* `sources` -- the source files of my thesis`

Build
-----

The thesis is written in LaTeX, with bibliography in BibTeX format, thus adequate compilers are required for both format.
For convenience, a build.sh script is present at the project root. The script assume both pdflatex and bibtex to be present in your PATH.

To run the script:
	./build.sh manuscrit

This will create the `manuscrit.pdf` file in a `generated` folder at the root, along with some other intermediary files.

NOTE: the `sources` folder contains the file `these_couv_full.pdf` which correspond to the cover used by my university. It is not used for the generration and (optionally) has to be appended at the beggining of the file manually.
